# Operating-Systems-Input-Files-I-O
This project is to implement an i-node based file system. Your 256MB hard drive uses 4KB blocks. Each i-node stores file/directory details and access permissions. The system supports file and directory operations like creation, removal, content addition, reading, copying, renaming, and linking.
